# Demo-Website-for-Professor-Bootstrap


This is a demo website I created for my professor as a part of my undergraduate student research fellowship for him to demo to clients.
This is a basic html website that leverages bootstrap with a simple javascript algorithm for the backend. 

Due to various requirement constraints, all variables are saved in the browser in local storage sessions instead of a database. This will make it easier for my professor to troubleshoot without me.
